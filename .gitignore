# Ignore all files WITHOUT an extension
# NOTE: This was done to ignore the extensionless binary files that are generated by
# the Makefile's.
# These binary files only appear in the src/ an test/ folders, so the exclusion patterns
# are only implemented there.

# Special python directory ignores
# NOTE: While ignoring *.py files in a "python" directory may seem completely wrong, it's
# not in this case.
# When this folder's Makefile is run (which is mandatory), it uses the git-tracked *.i files
# to generate the *.py (and *.c) files.
